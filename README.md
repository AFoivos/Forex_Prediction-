# Forex_Prediction-OnGoing 
rediction Models: Implements various machine learning and deep learning models for both Regression (forecasting future prices) and Classification (predicting price movement direction).

Classical Models: XGBoost, CatBoost.

Time Series Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs and GRUs).

Reinforcement Learning: Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with the Gym library to create and optimize trading strategies.

Feature Engineering: A powerful feature engineering pipeline to extract valuable information from raw time series data.

Automated: Utilizes TSfresh for automated feature extraction from time series data.

Custom Features: Includes custom-engineered features such as rolling statistics, lagged variables, percentage changes, and log returns.

Technical Indicators: Integrates a wide range of popular technical indicators (e.g., RSI, EMA, MACD) to enrich the dataset.

Data Handling: A modular object-oriented approach for handling and cleaning data from various sources (CSV, Database).
